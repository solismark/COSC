# (1) Joint All-Domain Operations
5 Operational Domains (Space, Cyber, Air, Land, Sea)

Space - Equal to or Greater than 100 Kilometers above the sea level. Airbourne objects become negligible. 

Cyberspace - Global domain consisting of an interdependent network of information technology infrastructures. 
1) Physical Network Layer - IT Devices 
2) Logical Network Layer - 
3) Cyber-persona Layer - How you appear on the cyber network.

Access can be gained through an combination of wired, optical, or wireless means. While some access can be achieved remotely though permissions. There are multiple ways to get access. 

Air 

Land

Sea 


 Joint All-Domain Ops 

Integration of all service component and functional component operational structures at local and regional echelons to cordinate and synchronize land, air, maritime, cyber and space operations with ease and to greater extend than currently exist today. Utilizing all domains to gain a physical, psycological, and influence of the operational environment.

 Joint Operations
 Why a Joint Force?
Incapable of coordinating land, sea, and air activities across its two military departments (War and Navy)
Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) created in 1942 
Franklin D Roosevelt created the JCS by executive direction, primarily to work with the british, who had a combined chiefs of staff organization

 National Security ACT 
1947 created the National Military Establishment (DOD Precursor) 
Prescribed a weak SECDEF
Gave legal standing to the Joint Chief Staff but NO chairman
Continued to empower the Military Department Secretaries as members of both the Cabinet and the new National Security Council (NSC) service domination also continued to trump the authority of unified commanders in the field.

Military Departments retained a de facto role in the operational chain of command and NEVER COMPLIED with the provision of strengthening the unified commanders

Joint Task Force                                      / Capabilities
Subordinate Unified Commands   


 How did we get here?
Numerous military failures highlighted institutional deficiencies at ALL levels. The adhoc nature of the joint effort in these operations contributed to an inability to effectively link tactical actions to strategic ends. 


 Goldwater-Nichols Act 1986
IN addition to the impetus provided by these operational failures, several disparate factors came together in the mid 1980s, which enabled DOD organizational changes. These included extensive congressional hearings, a major senate inquiry, bi-partisan, openness to rectify the situation, a presidential commission, and the appointment of a reform-minded CJCS, Admiral William Crowe, in October 1985.

 Forces
Global Force Management (GFM) is a group of related processes that establish strategic C2 and strategic posture and provide insight to the global military force avalability based on military plans and operations to support DoDs strategic decisions. GFM integrates directed readiness, assignment, allocation, appointment, and assessment processes for force management and planning constructs. 

SECDEF assigns allocates and apportions forces to CCDRs for planning to meet current operational requirements, and to accomplish CCDRs.

 Unified Commands
Joint commmands are asstablished by missions and responsibilities often based on either a geographic AOR or functions

CCDRs forces can operate wherever they are required to accomplish missions

 Geographic Commands
AFRICOM
CENTCOM
EUCOM
SPACECOM
NORTHCOM
INDOPACOM
SOUTHCOM

 Functional Commands
Can work across the Georgraphical Commands

SOCOM
CYBERCOM
STRATCOM
TRANSCOM

 Information Environment and Operations 
is the aggregate of social cultureal psychological technical and physical factors that affect how humans and automated systems derive meaning from, and act upon, and are impacted by information, including th einfividuals, organizations, and systems that collect, process, disseminate, or use information.

Informational Aspect

Physical Aspect

Human Aspect


Informational aspects reglect the way that individuals, information systems, and group communicate and exchange information. Informational aspects are the sensory inputs of activities that a receiver interprets and uses to assign meaning

Physical aspects are the material characterisics


 Operations in the Information Environment (OIE)
OIE are military actions involving the intergrated employment of mulitple information forces to affect drivers of behavior by informing audiences; influencing foreign relevant actors

 Two Goals
Informational Advantage - The operational advantage gained through the joint forces use of information for decision making and its ability to leverage information to create effects on the IE

Informational Power - The ability to use information to support achievement of objectives and gain an informational advantage

The elevation of information as a joint function impacts all operations and signals a fundamental appreciation for the military role of information at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels within todays complex OE.

 Assessment
Assessment of information in joint operations are conducted in accordance with the Operation Assessment Process

 Organizing for OIE
Information forces, the building bl;ocks of OIE units, are those Active Component and Reserve Component forces specifically organized, trained, and equipped to create and/or support the creation of effects on the IE

 Joint Organizations in OIE
JIOWC
JPSE-PA
JEWC
JISE
JIOC
DMA

 Interagency in OIE
Effective intregration of the appropriate US government oranizations will enhance the overall sucess of joint force operations. 

 PA
PA organizations and personnel focus on the OIE core activity of informating domestic, international, and internal audiences. External publics include allies, neutrals, adversaries, and potential adversaries

 CMO
Civil military operations; activities that establish mainitain and influence and exploit relationships between military forces, indigenous populations

MISO Military information support operations
miso are planned operations to convery selected information and indicator to foreign audiences to influence their emotions, motives, objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of foreign gov org groups.

 Military Deceptions
Commands conduct MILDEC to mislead enemy decision makers and commanders and cause them to take or not take specific actions.

 Combat Camera (COMCAM)

 Cyberspace Operations
CO employ cyberspace capabilities to acheive objectives in or through cyberspace


# (2) EMS / EW 

The electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) is a maneuver space essential for facilitating control within the operational environment (OE) and impacts all portions of OE and military operations.

JWC JOint warfighting concept was developed to address the join forces need to adapt to the changing character of war and geopolitical landscape which requires an integrated and interoperable, multi-domain capable, joint and coalition force to demonstrate credible deterrence. 
Defend the homeland
Deter strategic attacks against the U.S. our allies and partners
Deter aggression while being prepared to prevail in conflict
Ensure our future military advantage

The NSS is a presidential document providing policy guidance issued through the National Security Council NSC which align and direct the instruments of national power in support of policy objectives.

Joint electromagnetic spectrum operations (JEMSO) are military actions undertaken by a joint force to exploit, attack, protect, and manage the electromagnetic environment.

JEMSO-Related mission areas:
- Cyberspace Operations (CO)
- Space Operations - All space operations rely on EMS for command and control (C2), sensing, and information distribution. 
- Air, Land, and Maritime Operations

The EMS as the range of all types of electromagnetic radiation is a fundamental component of the natural environment and the electromagnetic operational environment (EMOE) is a space in which military functions are performed.

The EMOE is a manuever space, battlespace, place where competition and warfare, as well as commerce and other nonmilitary activities, are conducted.

EMEO Complexity:
- Contested - Enemy activities detect, disrupt, exploit, degrade, deny, deceive, or destroy freindly EMS copabilities

- Congested - Military civilian EMS dependent systems continue to crowd the spectrum and increase the amount of unintentional interference.

- Constrained - Domestic and international regulations cause the amount of spectrum available for military access to decrease.

Electromagnetic Warfare includes three major subdivisions:
- Electromagnetic Attack (EA) Destructive (Directed Energy) Non-Destructive (EW Jamming and EM Deception Herding) 
- Electromagnetic Protection (EP) Protect from friendly EW and enemy EW and Frequency Deconfliction
- Electromagnetic Support (ES) Direction Finding, Threat Warning, Collections to support EW

Offensive EM:
Jamming
Directed energy weapons
EM Pulse
Decption

Defensive EM:
Jamming
Directed energy
Deception
Expendables 
Unmanned Systems
EM Intrusion

Protection:
De-confliction
Emission Control
Electromagnetic Masking
Electromagnetic Security

Support:
Electromagnetic Reconnaissance
Threat Warning
Direction Finding

EW Capabilities are integrated with Cyebr Operations (CO), Electronic Warfare (EW), and SIGINT provided by the MICO company.

# (3) Space Operations

Space operations are operations impacting or directly utilizing space and ground-based capabilities to enhance the potential of the United States and multinational partners. Joint space forces are the space and terrestrial systems, equipment, facilities, organizations, and personnel, or combination thereof, necessary to conduct space operations.

Space Situational Awareness
Space Control
Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT)
Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance (ISR)
Satellite Communications

Space Situation Awareness : SSA is the requisite foundational, current, and predictive knowledge and characterization of space objects and the OE upon which space operations depenmd, to include physical, virtual, information, human dimensions, as well as all factors activities, and evcents of all entities conducting, or preparing to conduct space operations.

- Offensive Space Control (OSC)
- Deceive 
- Disrupt  
- Deny 
- Degrade
- Destroy

- Defensive Space Control (DSC)

- Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)

The ground segment also referred to as terrestrial segment. Link segement subspectible to upling and downlink jamming as well as cyberspace attacks. Space segments are vulnerble to ASAT weapons, directed energy weapons, etc.

Space Segment:
The ability to conduct operations that access exploit and defend space rests on simultaneous action across all domains, but require consideration of the space domains unique physical, network, and cognitive dimensions.
Physical Dimension
Network Dimension
Cognitive Dimension
 
Nation State threat - are potentially the most dangerous due to resource access, personnel and time.

Individual or Small group threats - can illegally disrupt or gain access to systems or facilities

Non-state threats - are formal and informal organizations not bound by national borders

Man made and natural hazards - disruption from human error, industrial incidents and natural disasters.


Mission assurance:
Defensive Operations
Reconstitution
Resilience
Deterrence


# (4) Cyber Operations

Cyberspace Operations use Links and nodes located in the physical domain and perform logical functions to create effects first in cyberspace and then as needed in the physical domain.

Operatons in the cyberspace rely on networked, stand-alone

OCO
DCO


DODIN Operation
Department of Defense Information Network (DODIN)

DODIN Operations mission is to secure configure operate extend maintian and sustaion DOD cyberspace to create and preserve the confidentiality availability and integrity of the DODIN

- DCO-RA Response Action (RED)
DCO missions where actions are taken external to the defended network or portion of the cyberspace without the permission of the owner

- DCO-IDM Internal Defense Measures (BLUE)
DCO missions where authorized cyberspace defensive actions occur

- HFO Hunt Forward Operations (GRAY and RED)
DCO-IDM missions to hunt for threats in gray or red cyberspace, at the invitation of a foreign governement


Threat and Challenges to Cyberspace
Anonymty and Difficulties with Attribution
Geographic Challenges - There is no stateless manuever space in cyberspace
Technology Challenges - Cyberspace capabilities rely on the ability to exploit vulnerabilities
Private Industry and Public Infrastructure - Many of the DoD's critical function rely on contracted
Glovalization - global operations makes the DoD reliant on foreign vendors for IT services
Mitigations - DoD partners with the Defense Industry Base (DIB) to increase security


OCO misions are intended to project power in and through gray and red cyberspace
Cyberspace Exploitation - access creation, military intelligence activities, manuever, information collection, and other enabling actions to prepare for future operations
- ISR - Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance in Cyberspace
- C-S&R Cyberspace - Surveilance and Reconnaissance

Cyberspace Attack - actions create noticeable denial effects in cyberspace or manipulation that leads to denial effect in the physical domains
D4M
Deny - 
 - Degrade
 - Disrupt
 - Destroy
Deny encompasses all the following above.

The goal of DCO is to defeat the threat of a specific adversary and/or return a compromised network to a secure and functional state.
Cyberspace Defense * DEFEAT
Cyberspace Security * REDUCE
Cyberspace System Operations

Secure, configure, operate, extend, maintain, and sustain DOD cyberspace and to create and preserve the CIA triad of DODIN.


# (5) DODIN and DODIN OPs

DODIN operations to secure configure operate extend maintain and susatin DOD cyberspace to create and preserves that CIA triad of the DODIN

# (6) Cyber Laws and Authorities

LOAC Law of Armed Conflict is made up of customary international law and treaty law

International treaty law is also referred to and considered intarnational humanitarian law (IHL)

Treaty law is comprised of:
Geneva Law
Hague Convention
Developments in Treaty Law
Chemical Weapons Convention

Though LOAC and LOW are typically considered interchangeable one differnce you may note through international and national doctrine is their associated principles

Applications of the law of war in all other military operations members of thdod act consistent with th elaw of wars fundamentals principles and rules which included the princisples of military necessity humanity and distinctiion proportionality and honor 

the dod law of war program in conjuction with the dod law of war manual seeks to address the law of war that is applicable to the united states including treaties to which the united states is a party and application of customary international law


IHL appl;ies to the belligerent parties irrespective of the reasons for conflict or justness of the cause for which they are fighting IGL is intended to protext victums of armed conflicts regardless of party affiliation that is why jus in bello must remain indepependan t
