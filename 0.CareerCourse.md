controlling the interview techniques
packaging and bridging to keep the conversations rolling and allows for the audience to follow

Relax; be yourself.
• Tell the truth, even if it is painful. You will maintain credibility by doing so.
• Explain as much as you can if you cannot discuss something (e.g., “to answer your question
could compromise operational security” or “the matter remains under investigation”). “No
comment” isn’t an appropriate response when provided an opportunity to represent your unit
or the Marine Corps.
• Tell the reporter if you do not know the answer to a question and offer to get back to the
reporter later with the answer, if possible.
• Avoid military or technical jargon. Remember, your audience—foreign and domestic.
• Answer directly and give the bottom line upfront; you can amplify later.
• Correct the record. If a reporter makes an error or has wrong information, make the
correction during the interview.
• Listen carefully to the reporter; ask for repetition or clarification, if necessary.
• Maintain eye contact; make sure the reporter knows you are interested and paying attention.
• Be expressive and try to be interesting.
• Be humorous, if appropriate. Humor can be one of the best forms of communication.
• Maintain a positive attitude.
• Talk “on the record” or not at all.
• Be prepared to answer the five "Ws" and the "H": who, what, where, when, why, and how.
• Assume that you are on the air, even if you are told that you are off; technical crews make
mistakes.
• Be modest but confident. You are the expert, but do not be condescending.
• Use the studio monitor to check your appearance before air time, then maintain eye contact
with the reporter and ignore the monitor.
• Do not lose your temper—even if provoked. The only part they may air is you losing your
temper not what prompted it.
• Do not drum your fingers, twiddle your thumbs, tap your feet, or act nervous.
• Do not look around the room for the answer; it gives the impression of discomfort, bluffing,
or desperation.
• Do not speculate or comment on matters beyond your cognizance or responsibility ("stay in
your lane").
