## Man
man ___ command


## History
show a list of previous commands


## Cat
```
cat /etc/passwd
```
or
ls -lisa in /etc and /passwd
sometimes you wont be able to GO where you wanna work so you need to use absolute file paths


```
cat /etc/passwd > fakepasswd.txt
```
will allow you to essentially copy 

## Wordcount
wc -l

## MaxDepth

-maxdepth

## CD
```
cd..
```
takes you back one
```
cd ~
```
back to the root


## Touch
```
touch class005
```
ls -lisa and you wilhttps://linuxhandbook.com/find-exec-command/l see a new file has been made

```
touch -t 202406170606.00 
```
can change timestamps for obsfuscation

## LS
```
ls -lisa 
ls -1
```
will allow you to see 1 per line

```
ls ~/*.log
```
will grab ANNYTHING and EVERYTHING ending with ".log"

```
ls -lisa /etc
```

## CD
change directory

```
cd /home/student

```
```
cd -
```
will take you back to the PREVIOUS directory

insesitive case format of finding something

```
find -inum
```
finds INODE number

```
find -group name
```
find files with the groupname of name

```
find -user

will locate all that specific users files that are owned by them

```
find -uid 1001
```
will locate all that specific UID and/or GUID that are owned by them

```
find -maxdepth 1
```
sets a find max depth that it will only look for something for example it is 1 directory deep

```
find / -type (f/d)
```
find all FILES and DIRECTORYS

```
find -executable
```
will located executable files

```
find / -inum 38 2>/dev/null
```
shows the output without any errors otherwise we see all the permission denied and file not available issues

```
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d
```
. will find in the current directory only 1 directory deep and returns a list of directories


```
find -printf "%i %f\n"

%i       %f
40328202 1.txt
40328203 2.txt
40328204 3.txt

```
%i is for inode number %f is for filename and printf is another way to format the way something is outputted


```
find /var -empty
```
-empty will find all files and directories that are empty


## New line
/n


## GREP
Grab regular expressions
```
cat fakepasswd.txt | grep /bin/bash
```
will search through the passwd fake and find who has default /bin/bash shells

```
grep -E
or
egrep
```
allows for extended GREP when using REGEX

```
grep -v /bin/bash
```
INVERTS and searches for everything opposite of the argument


## Brace Expansion
```
mkdir breky11{23,45,67}
breky1123

## SBIN
System Binarys

## Boolean

'''
find $HOME/1123 -name *.txt ! -name *~*
'''


## PS 
Process List
```
ps -elf

kill

pkill

killall
```
ps -elf shows the process list
kill uses the process ID number
pkill is using the process name
-9 option can be added to force kill

## Cut
```
cat fakepasswd | cut -d: -f1
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
```
cat fakepasswd will send all the text to the screen and cut will allow you to cut with a -d dilimeter of a : and the field 1 

```
cat fakepasswd |  cut -d -f1 -s

```
-s is strict

you can also add a thru option with the -f fields 

```

cat fakepasswd |  cut -d -f1-3 -s

```

-f2- will give you everything after the field 2 or whatever field that was given







# BASH Activities
## 01
Activity: Using Brace-Expansion, create the following directories within the $HOME directory:

    1123
    1134
    1145
    1156


```
mkdir 11{23,34,45,56}
```

## 01.2
Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt
    4.txt
    5.txt
    6~.txt
    7~.txt
    8~.txt
    9~.txt
```
cd 1123
touch {1,2,3,4,5,6~,7~,8~,9~}.txt

```
## 01.3
Using the find command, list all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt.

Be aware that if you use Pattern Matching to locate the files you may have unintended results based on if you use quotes around the pattern or not. If you do not quote the pattern, the Bash shell interprets the pattern. If you quote the pattern, it is passed to the command for it to interpret. You can have a properly functioning command, yet unintended output, based on which of these two gets to interpret the pattern.

```
cd 1123
find -name *.txt
```
## 01.3


Challenge Activity:

List all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.

While this activity can be accomplished with only find, it can also be combined with grep as well.

```
find $HOME/1123 -name '*.txt' | grep -v ~.txt

```

## 02


Activity:

Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.

Use only the find and cp commands. You will need to utilize the -exec option on find to accomplish this activity.

The find command uses BOOLEAN "!" to designate that it does not want to find any files or directories that follows.


```
find $HOME/1123 -name '*.txt' -not -name '*~*' -exec cp {} $HOME/CUT \;

```

## 03


Activity:

Using ONLY the find command, find all empty files/directories in directory /var and print out ONLY the filename (not absolute path), and the inode number, separated by newlines.

Tip: When using the man pages, it is better to focus your search then to visually scan 1000+ lines of text. Combining the output with the grep command, possibly with its -A, -B, or -C options, can help drive context driven searches of those manual pages.

Example Output

123 file1
456 file2
789 file3

```
find /var -empty -printf "%i %f\n"

```

## 04


Activity:

Using ONLY the find command, find all files on the system with inode 4026532575 and print only the filename to the screen, not the absolute path to the file, separating each filename with a newline. Ensure unneeded output is not visible.

Tip: The above inode is specific to this CTFd question and might not be in use on your Linux Opstation. Instead, you can test your command on your Linux OpStation against inode 999.
 func
```
find / -inum 4026532575 -printf "%f\n" 2>/dev/null

```

## 05
Activity:

    Using only the ls -l and cut Commands, write a BASH script that shows all filenames with extensions ie: 1.txt, etc., but no directories, in $HOME/CUT.
    Write those to a text file called names in $HOME/CUT directory.
    Omit the names filename from your output.

```

ls -l $HOME/CUT | cut -d. -f1- -s | cut -d: -f2 | cut -d' ' -f2 > $HOME/CUT/names

```
-s cuts on the period -d. and if it doesnt have it then it doesnt show

-d: will cut on the : between the time

-d' ' now cuts on the space 53 title.txt to title.txt

once thats done you send it to >> $HOME/CUT/names

## 06
Activity:

Write a basic bash script that greps ONLY the IP addresses in the text file provided (named StoryHiddenIPs in the current directory); sort them uniquely by number of times they appear.

It is not important to have a regular expression that only catches fully valid IP addresses. It is more important that you become familiar with creating and using regular expressions. Below, there are some useful websites that you can use to visually see what your regular expression pattern is matching on.

```
grep -oE '\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b' StoryHiddenIPs | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```
grep for the ip addresses 
in order to sort them by how many times they appear we sort
then send it to uniq -c for the count 
then we sort for numerically reversed to order them correctly
from 
1
2
3
5
1
2
to going to 
5
3
2
1



## 07
Activity:

    Using ONLY the awk command, write a BASH one-liner script that extracts ONLY the names of all the system and user accounts that are not UIDs 0-3.
    Only display those that use /bin/bash as their default shell.
    The input file is named $HOME/passwd and is located in the current directory.
    Output the results to a file called $HOME/SED/names.txt
```
awk -F: '$3 > 3 && $7 == "/bin/bash" {print $1}' $HOME/passwd > $HOME/SED/names.txt
```

since the UID field is 3 we set the value to be above 3 since 0-3 is being asked to be left out

awk -F: = field seperator is equal to a :
'$3 > 3 && $NF(or $7) == "/bin/bash" {print $1}' = this is saying that if field 3 is greater than 3 and if the last field $NF or the $7th field as we know it is == "/bin/bash" then to {print $1} the first field




## 08
Activity:

    Find all dmesg kernel messages that contain CPU or BIOS (uppercase) in the string, but not usable or reserved (case-insensitive)
    Print only the msg itself, omitting the bracketed numerical expressions ie: [1.132775]

```
dmesg | grep -e "CPU" -e "BIOS" | grep -v -i -e "usable" -e "reserved" | cut -d"]" -f2-
```

## 09

    Write a Bash script using "Command Substitution" to replace all passwords, using openssl, from the file $HOME/PASS/shadow.txt with the MD5 encrypted password: Password1234, with salt: bad4u
    Output of this command should go to the screen/standard output.
    You are not limited to a particular command, however you must use openssl. Type man openssl passwd for more information.

```
#!/bin/bash
# Define the plain text password and salt that are being applied

plain="Password1234"
salt="bad4u"

# Create a way to generate MD5 encrypted password

md5(){
openssl passwd -1 -salt "$salt" "$plain"

}

# Process each line in the shadow.txt and replace passwords

while IFS=: read -r user old_password rest_of_line; do
    new_password=$(md5)
    echo "$username:$new_password:$rest_of_line"
done < "$HOME/PASS/shadow.txt"
```

## 10

Using ONLY sed, write all lines from $HOME/passwd into $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt that do not end with either /bin/sh or /bin/false.

```
sed -e '\/bin\/sh/d' -e '\/bin\/false/d' $HOME/passwd > $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt
```
we use sed -e to delete both the /bin/sh and /bin/false from the $HOME/passwd file using the "d" option after the file paths
once we delete them we can > them to the $HOME/PASS/passwd.txt

## 11

    Using find, find all files under the $HOME directory with a .bin extension ONLY.
    Once the file(s) and their path(s) have been found, remove the file name from the absolute path output.
    Ensure there is no trailing / at the end of the directory path when outputting to standard output.
    You may need to sort the output depending on the command(s) you use.

```
find $HOME -name "*.bin" -type f | rev | cut -d'/' -f2- | rev | sort -u

```

so first we find in the $HOME all files -type f with the file extension of -name "*.bin" once we have a list we can reverse it with rev to be able to cut -d'/' -f2- to grab everthing minus the filename.extension then we reverse it again and sort u 

## 12
 Write a script which will copy the last entry/line in the passwd-like file specified by the $1 positional parameter
    Modify the copied line to change:
        User name to the value specified by $2 positional parameter
        Used id and group id to the value specified by $3 positional parameter
        Home directory to a directory matching the user name specified by $2 positional parameter under the /home directory
        The default shell to `/bin/bash'
    Append the modified line to the end of the file

```

```


## 13
Activity:

    Find all executable files under the following four directories:
        /bin
        /sbin
        /usr/bin
        /usr/sbin
    Sort the filenames with absolute path, and get the md5sum of the 10th file from the top of the list.

```
#!/bin/bash
a=$(find /bin /sbin /usr/sbin /usr/bin -type f -executable | sort | head -10 | tail -1)
b=$(md5sum $a | cut -d" " -f1)
echo $b

```
the a is listing all the files that are executable and sorting them then we send that to head 10 to grab the first ten and tail -1 to grab the last one in the list

we then use b to md5sum the output of that directory and send it to cut the hash and directory from eachother


## 14

    Sort the /etc/passwd file numerically by the GID field.
    For the 10th entry in the sorted passwd file, get an md5 hash of that entry’s home directory.
    Output ONLY the MD5 hash of the directory's name to standard output.

```
sort -t: -k 4 /etc/passwd -n | head -10 | tail -1 | awk -F: '{print $6}' | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1

```

-t is dilimeter
-k column 4 to sort -N numerically on the GUID
we head and tail to grab the first 10 and the last 
the we awk to format it to print the 6th field and mdfsum it 

## 15


    Write a script which will find and hash the contents 3 levels deep from each of these directories: /bin /etc /var
    Your script should:
        Exclude named pipes. These can break your script.
        Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to separate files.
        Determine the count of files hashed in the file with hashes.
        Determine the count of unsuccessfully hashed directories.
        Have both counts output to the screen with an appropriate title for each count.
```
#!/bin/bash
find /bin /etc /var -maxdepth 3 ! -type p -exec md5sum {} \; 1>good.txt 2>bad.txt
a=$(wc -l good.txt | cut -d' ' -f1)
b=$(cat bad.txt | grep "Is a directory" | wc -l | cut -d' ' -f1)
echo "Successfully Hashed Files: "$a
echo "Unsuccessfully Hashed Directories: "$b

```

## 16

Design a script that detects the existence of directory: $HOME/.ssh

Upon successful detection, copies any and all files from within the directory $HOME/.ssh to directory $HOME/SSH and produce no output. You will need to create $HOME/SSH.
Upon un-successful detection, displays the error message "Run ssh-keygen" to the user.

```
a=$(find $HOME -name ".ssh" 2>/dev/null)
b="$HOME/.ssh"
c=$(cp -a "$a" $HOME/SSH)
mkdir $HOME/SSH
if [[ $a == $b ]]
    then $c
else echo "Run ssh-keygen"
fi

```

## 17


# Day 2

## awk 
awk options (-F:) 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file

awk -F: '$3 > 3 && $7 == "/bin/bash" {print $1}' $HOME/passwd > $HOME/SED/names.txt

language inside of a language

```
cat fakepasswd.txt | awk -F: '{print $1}'

```
awk -F: is saying that the fields are seperated by : and '{print $1,$3}' allows us to print those fields

```
cat fakepasswd.txt | awk -F: '{print $NF}'
```
$NF grabs the last field


```
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '($3 >= 150){print $0}'
```
$0 will print all string data that matches
($3 >= 150) is saying if field 3 is greater than or equal to 150

```
cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: 'BEGIN {OFS="#"}{print $1,$6,$5}'
root#/root#0

root:/root:0
```
OFS="#" allows you to change what the results are of the parse outputted format

## sort
sort contents depending on the order on the ASCII table

```
ps aux | sort -k 1

```
-k is columns
allows us to sort by what is in the -k column 1
-n numerically

```
ps aux | sort -T
```
-T is field seperator

-u is unique

## uniq
uniq has to have things sorted before it can be uniq
uniq -c = uniq count


https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/76049/what-is-the-difference-between-sort-u-and-sort-uniq

## Aliases



cat = open
nano = vi
vi = nano

## sed
sed OPTIONS... [SCRIPT] [INPUTFILE...] 

-e expression for multiple sed patterns
s is substitution start pattern with substitute patter
g is for globally throughout the file
d deletes the entire line
$ means end of line

sed -n: This option suppresses automatic printing of pattern space. We use it to control when to print explicitly.

```
cat pizza.txt[ echo {100..999} | grep -we $a ]

chicken
pepperonis
cheese
bacon
chicken
chicken chicken
chicken pizza

sed -e 's/chicken/hamburger/g' -e 's/pepperoni/sausage/' pizza.txt

hamburger hamburger
hamburger pizza

sed -e 's/chicken/hamburger/g pizza.txt

hamburger
pepperonis

sed -e '/chicken/d' pizza.txt (deletes the whole line)

pepperoni pepperoni
cheese pepperoni
bacon
pineapple
pepperoni
```

# Practice Test


Create a script that will perform the following actions:

    Replace every instance of 'cat' in "infile" with 'dog'.
    Replace every instance of 'Navy' in "infile" with 'Army'.
    Replacements are case-sensitive.
    Write the output to the file specifed by the variable 'outfile'.
```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  infile=$1
  outfile=$2

  sed -e 's/cat/dog/g' -e 's/Navy/Army/g' $infile >> $outfile
}
```
SED replaces a word for a word /sword1/word2/g


Create a script that will print to standard output all user names from the /etc/passwd file.

```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  #none
  cat /etc/passwd | cut -d: -f1
}

```

cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd



Create a script that will perform the following actions:

    Print to standard output all usernames from the file path specified by the parameter filename sorted ascending numerically by user id.
    The file will be in the format of /etc/passwd


```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  filename=$1
  sort -t: -k3 -n $filename | cut -d: -f1

}

```

Create a script that will perform the following actions:

    Delete all files contained in the directory specified by dirdel
    Also delete the directory specified by dirdel

```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirdel=$1
  rm -rf $dirdel
}

```
rmdir -r $dirdel
or
rm -r $dirdel

Create a script that will perform the following actions:

    Create a file specified by the name newfile.
    Set the file modified date to the value specified in filedate and time to '1730'. NOTE: filedate contains only a valid date in YYYYMMDD format, not a time.

```

function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  newfile=$1
  filedate=$2
  mytime=1730.00
  echo . > $newfile
  touch -t $filedate$mytime $newfile
}
```



Create a sorted full-path list of all files in the directory dirpath that were modified within the previous day. Directories should not be included in the output. Print the list to the screen, one item per line.

NOTE: The full paths to files should be in your output. (i.e. /etc/passwd would be included)

NOTE: Directory entries should not be included. (i.e. /etc would NOT be included)


```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirpath=$1
  find $dirpath -mtime -1 -type f | sort

}


```
sort
-mtime is modified time
-1 is meaning one day before as in minus 1
-type is for files
0 works for the last day


Terminate the process that has the randomly assigned name specified by procname variable. procname does not contain path information.

```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  procname=$1
  #Your code here
  pkill $procname

```
killall $procname


Copy all lines from the file specified by src variable to the file specified by dst variable which DO NOT contain the text specified by match variable.

```
function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  src=$1
  dst=$2
  match=$3
  grep -vwE $match $src > $dst
}

```
cat $src | grep -v $match > $dst



    Print to standard output the total number of files in the directory specified by dirname.
    If the directory does not exist, print 'Invalid Directory'
    The count excludes the '.' and '..' pseudo-directories.

```

     

function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirname=$1
  ls -1 $dirname | wc -l
}
```





Read the file specified by fname and perform an action based on the contents of the file:

    If contents are 0 to 9, print "single digit" to standard output.
    If contents are 10 to 99, print "double digit" to standard output.
    If contents are 100 to 999, print "triple digit" to standard output.
    Otherwise, print "Error" to standard output.

```
cont=(cat $fname)
if [[ $cont -lt 10 ]] ; then
    echo single digit
elif [[ $cont -lt 100 ]] ; then
    echo double digit
elif [[ $cont -lt 1000 ]] ; then
    echo triple digit
else
    echo Error
fi

```



tar -czf





{Bash)

    Print all lines from the file specified as "filename" file to standard output that are not blank lines and are not comments.
    Comments are lines which include a '#' as the first character.
    Do not print anything else to standard output for this question.
    The format of the input file will be similar to that of the /etc/hosts file.

function q1()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  filename=$1
  #You code here
  egrep -v '^#|^$' $filename
}
---------------------------------------------------

    Locate all files that end in ".log" in the specified directory by "logs"
    Create an archive of those files in a gzipped tar ball
    Store the gzipped tar ball as the file name specified in "archive"
function q2()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  logs=$1
  archive=$2
  #Your code here
  find $logs -name '*.log' -exec tar -czf  $archive {} +
}
----------------------------------------------------

    Locate all files in the directory "searchdir" that contain the case insensitive text "CRITICAL".
    Write all the filenames with path into a file specified by argument "output".

IMPORTANT NOTE: The contents of the file are what matter, not the filename. No filenames will contain critical.
function q3()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  searchdir=$1
  output=$2
  #Your code here
  grep -ir 'CRITICAL' $searchdir | cut -d: -f1 > $output
}
-------------------------------------------------------

    Given a space separated list of directories in "dirlist", your code will obtain the total number of files in all the directories. Subdirectories will NOT be included in the total.
    Print to standard output the total number of files
function q4()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirlist=$1
  #You code here
  find $dirlist -type f -maxdepth 1 | wc -l
}
```

    Delete all files contained in the directory specified by "dirdel"
    Do not delete the directory specified by "dirdel"
```
function q5()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirdel=$1
  #Your code here
  rm -r $dirdel/*
}
```

    Create a file specified by the name contained in parameter "newfile"
    Set the modified date of the file to June 14, of the current year
    Set the modified time to the file to 0830
```
function q6()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  newfile=$1
  #Your code here
  touch -t 202406140830 $newfile
}
```
    Read the file specified by "filename" and perform an action based on the contents of the file
    If the contents of the file are "abc", print "123" to standard output
    If the contents of the file are "def", print "789" to standard output
    If the contents of the file are "xyz", print "000" to standard output
    If the contents of the file are not "abc", "def", or "xyz", print "Error" to standard output

```
function q7() {
  # Valid Variables are:
  filename=$1
  # Your code here
  A=$(cat "$filename")
 
  if [[ "$A" == "abc" ]]; then
    echo 123
  elif [[ "$A" == "def" ]]; then
    echo 789
  elif [[ "$A" == "xyz" ]]; then
    echo 000
  else
    echo Error
  fi
}
```
----------------------------------------------------
Create a script that will perform the following actions:
Copy all lines from the file specified by "src" to the file specified by "dst" which contain the text specified by "match"
 function q8()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  src=$1
  dst=$2
  match=$3
  #Your code here
  grep $match $src > $dst
}
-------------------------------------------------------

    Terminate the process that has the name specified by 'var'.
    The name of the process in 'var' varies and will change each time the application is run
```   
function q9()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  var=$1
  #Your code here
  pkill $1
}
```

    Given a directory specified by "dirpath" create a sorted list of all files in the directory that were modified within the previous hour.
    Ensure that the full path to each file is used for the sort and is included in the output.
    The list should include all files in the specified directory and any subdirectories.

 Print this list to the screen, one item on each line.
```
function q10()
{
  #Valid Variables are:
  dirpath=$1
  #Your code here
  find $1 -type f -mmin -60 | sort
}
```
