# Day 1

## Man
man ___ command


## History
show a list of previous commands


## Cat
```
cat /etc/passwd
```
or
ls -lisa in /etc and /passwd
sometimes you wont be able to GO where you wanna work so you need to use absolute file paths


```
cat /etc/passwd > fakepasswd.txt
```
will allow you to essentially copy 


## CD
```
cd..
```
takes you back one
```
cd ~
```
back to the root


## Touch
```
touch class005
```
ls -lisa and you wilhttps://linuxhandbook.com/find-exec-command/l see a new file has been made

```
touch -t 202406170606.00 
```
can change timestamps for obsfuscation

## LS
```
ls -lisa 
ls -1
```
will allow you to see 1 per line

```
ls ~/*.log
```
will grab ANNYTHING and EVERYTHING ending with ".log"

```
ls -lisa /etc
```

## CD
change directory

```
cd /home/student

```
```
cd -
```
will take you back to the PREVIOUS directory

## Locate
can find files and directorys
```
locate find
```
will return find from anywhere and everywhere

## Find
```
find -name
```
case sensitive format of finding something

```
find -iname
```
insesitive case format of finding something

```
find -inum
```
finds INODE number

```
find -group name
```
find files with the groupname of name

```
find -user
```  
will locate all that specific users files that are owned by them

```
find -uid 1001
```
will locate all that specific UID and/or GUID that are owned by them

```
find -maxdepth 1
```
sets a find max depth that it will only look for something for example it is 1 directory deep

```
find / -type (f/d)
```
find all FILES and DIRECTORYS

```
find -name \*.txt
```
will find all the files ending with .txt

```
find -atime 3
```
anything ACCESSED within the past 3 days or whatever days

```
find -ctime 3
```
anything CHANGED within the past 3 days or whatever days

```
find -mtime 3
```
anything MODIFIED within the past 3 days or whatever days


```
find -(a/c/m)min -30
```
min is added to see modified/accessed/changed witin mins 


```
find -executable
```
will located executable files

```
find / -inum 38 2>/dev/null
```
shows the output without any errors otherwise we see all the permission denied and file not available issues

```
find . -maxdepth 1 -type d
```
. will find in the current directory only 1 directory deep and returns a list of directories


## New line
/n


## GREP
Grab regular expressions
```
cat fakepasswd.txt | grep /bin/bash
```
will search through the passwd fake and find who has default /bin/bash shells

```
grep -E
or
egrep
```
allows for extended GREP when using REGEX

```
grep -v /bin/bash
```
INVERTS and searches for everything opposite of the argument


## Brace Expansion
```
mkdir breky11{23,45,67}
breky1123
breky1145
breky1167

```
will allow you to make more stuff quicker 



## FIND -EXEC 
```
find [path] [argument] -exec [command] {} \;
```
will do the find and then execute a command for the find


## PWD
Present working directory PWD will print the current directory


## CP
can copy from source to destination


## MV 
can rename something and move from source to destination


## MKDIR
```
mkdir -p 
```
makes a parent directory


## RMDIR
will remove a directory
rmdir - p will remove a parent directory if needed


## RM
remove will delete a file
rm -r is recursively
rm -rf is recursively and with for 


## UMASK
umask shows the default permissions


## CHMOD 
will alfind -name *~.txt | grep -v *.txtlow you to change permissions for a file and we are good to run a 777


## ETC
ETC is everything configurable so pretty much all your conf files and generic files are here


## BIN
Binarys


## SBIN
System Binarys

## Boolean

'''
find $HOME/1123 -name *.txt ! -name *~*
'''

# BASH Activities
## One
Activity: Using Brace-Expansion, create the following directories within the $HOME directory:

    1123
    1134
    1145
    1156


```
mkdir 11{23,34,45,56}
```

## Two
Use Brace-Expansion to create the following files within the $HOME/1123 directory. You may need to create the $HOME/1123 directory. Make the following files, but utilze Brace Expansion to make all nine files with one touch command.

Files to create:

    1.txt
    2.txt
    3.txt
    4.txt
    5.txt
    6~.txt
    7~.txt
    8~.txt
    9~.txt
```
cd 1123
touch {1,2,3,4,5,6~,7~,8~,9~}.txt

```
## Three
Using the find command, list all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt.

Be aware that if you use Pattern Matching to locate the files you may have unintended results based on if you use quotes around the pattern or not. If you do not quote the pattern, the Bash shell interprets the pattern. If you quote the pattern, it is passed to the command for it to interpret. You can have a properly functioning command, yet unintended output, based on which of these two gets to interpret the pattern.

```
cd 1123
find -name *.txt
```
## Four


Challenge Activity:

List all files in $HOME/1123 that end in .txt. Omit the files containing a tilde (~) character.

While this activity can be accomplished with only find, it can also be combined with grep as well.

```
find $HOME/1123 -name '*.txt' | grep -v ~.txt

```

## Five


Activity:

Copy all files in the $HOME/1123 directory, that end in ".txt", and omit files containing a tilde "~" character, to directory $HOME/CUT.

Use only the find and cp commands. You will need to utilize the -exec option on find to accomplish this activity.

The find command uses BOOLEAN "!" to designate that it does not want to find any files or directories that follows.


```
find $HOME/1123 -name '*.txt' -not -name '*~*' -exec cp {} $HOME/CUT \;

```


## PS 
Process List
```
ps -elf

kill

pkill

killall
```
ps -elf shows the process list
kill uses the process ID number
pkill is using the process name
-9 option can be added to force kill

## Cut
