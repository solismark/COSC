influence of media -

tactical level
information tha troops recieve about public opinion can affect troop moreal and combat effeciency

operational level
as the link between the tactical and strategic  media coverage at this level will hace implications for current and future operations

strategic level
war is an instrument of polotics is driven by public support we cannot accomplish our goals in a theater of operation without public support

marines have the responsibility to tell the marine corps story

to keep the media and public informed so their options of the corps are not skewed

roles of public affairs
relationship with media and public
understanding
credibility
trust
mutually beneficial

Principle of information
tenets of public affairs

honesty builds credibility
 Because every Marine is perceived as a credible spokesperson, telling the Marine Corps story is a responsibility.


provide consistent information
he public often receives simultaneous information from a variety of official DoD sources at various levels.   

badnews doesnt get better with age
Withholding or appearing to withhold negative information creates the perception of cover-ups, leads to speculation, and damages the credibility of the Marine Corps. 


if news is out its out
s public and media interest increases, the ability to limit or restrict information flow decreases.

telling our storyu is good
lthough commanders use designated personnel as official spokespersons, they should educate and encourage all their personnel to tell the Marine Corps story by providing them with timely information that is appropriate for public release.  

the marine corps family is important
Internal audiences include Marines, civilian employees, retirees, and all affiliated family members throughout the Marine Corps.  This audience must be well informed to ensure maximum effectiveness and the highest sustainable morale. 

the media is not the enemy
The vast majority of journalists and the organizations they represent are committed to the ideals of providing responsible, accurate, and balanced coverage.  

practice security at teh source
All individuals are responsible for protecting sensitive information

PA mission is to communicate and engae with domestic and foreign publics to build understnading, credibility, trust, and mutually beneficial relationships

Print
This type may appear in a magazine and includes both in-person or on the phone; it is usually more lengthy than a broadcast interview.
Television
This type is usually conducted in an office, one-on-one with a reporter and a camera crew; as a rule, it is relaxed and informal.
Panel
This type is usually formal and organized, and uses a prepared discussion point or questions to talk with the board or group members.
Remote
The interviewer is geographically separated from the guest who will be viewed onscreen in this type of interview.
Press Conference
An individual delivers a statement to and fields questions from a group of reporters at a predetermined time and place in this type of interview.
Ambush
This type involves an unexpected and impromptu encounter that usually is disconcerting and face-to-face.
Radio

Meeting the media
Research the medium.
Research the content and possible questions.
Consult with your PA officer.
Prepare for delivery.
Prepare your appearance.
Know when you are being taped.
Gain situational awareness. 

Sometimes, the high points of a story will be condensed into segments, often less than 30 seconds in length. 
Express your major points in short 10- to 20-second statements.
Convey the most important messages first.
Elaborate only after making the main points


controlling the interview techniques
packaging and bridging to keep the conversations rolling and allows for the audience to follow

Relax; be yourself.
• Tell the truth, even if it is painful. You will maintain credibility by doing so.
• Explain as much as you can if you cannot discuss something (e.g., “to answer your question
could compromise operational security” or “the matter remains under investigation”). “No
comment” isn’t an appropriate response when provided an opportunity to represent your unit
or the Marine Corps.
• Tell the reporter if you do not know the answer to a question and offer to get back to the
reporter later with the answer, if possible.
• Avoid military or technical jargon. Remember, your audience—foreign and domestic.
• Answer directly and give the bottom line upfront; you can amplify later.
• Correct the record. If a reporter makes an error or has wrong information, make the
correction during the interview.
• Listen carefully to the reporter; ask for repetition or clarification, if necessary.
• Maintain eye contact; make sure the reporter knows you are interested and paying attention.
• Be expressive and try to be interesting.
• Be humorous, if appropriate. Humor can be one of the best forms of communication.
• Maintain a positive attitude.
• Talk “on the record” or not at all.
• Be prepared to answer the five "Ws" and the "H": who, what, where, when, why, and how.
• Assume that you are on the air, even if you are told that you are off; technical crews make
mistakes.
• Be modest but confident. You are the expert, but do not be condescending.
• Use the studio monitor to check your appearance before air time, then maintain eye contact
with the reporter and ignore the monitor.
• Do not lose your temper—even if provoked. The only part they may air is you losing your
temper not what prompted it.
• Do not drum your fingers, twiddle your thumbs, tap your feet, or act nervous.
• Do not look around the room for the answer; it gives the impression of discomfort, bluffing,
or desperation.
• Do not speculate or comment on matters beyond your cognizance or responsibility ("stay in
your lane").

during an interview 

operational security

information balancing act

the marinecorps has an obligation to provide timely and accurate information to the american people
 The release of information is impacted by many considerations including:

    DoD Principles of Information
    Freedom of Information Act
    Privacy Act
    Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
    Operations security (OPSEC)
    Host-nation sensitivities
    Information security
    Principles of Security, Accuracy, Policy and Propriety (SAPP)
    Public affairs guidance (PAG) issued by the command PA officer, Headquarters Marine Corps Division of PA, and DoD PA
    DoD, Navy, and Marine Corps publications, orders, directives, and instructions
    ALMAR 008/17


OPSEC

Every marine is an official spokesperson
you should be prepared to talk to a reporter at any time so to be prepared we must always know what is releasable or not

individuals are responsible for what they release.
Before releasing information, consider public affairs guidance (PAG) and operations security.
Don't jeopardize security, safety, or privacy.
Practice security at the source. 





Warfighting
 Warfighting is:

    A violent clash of interests (Marines only fight enemy combatants.)
    A violent struggle between wills, one trying to impose itself on the other (Marines do not harm enemy soldiers who surrender.)
    A social process
    The application or threat of violence by military forces used to restore or maintain order

leadership 3 dimensions
mental moral and physical

Friction is the force that resists all action and saps energy.  It makes the simple difficult and the difficult seemingly impossible.
Friction can be mental or physical.
It can come from enemy actions, terrain, and weather, or it can be self-imposed. 
the main weapon against friction is human will
training and experience will teach us to fight in an environment of friction

uncertanty referred to as the fog of war
unpredictability 
risk equally common to action and inaction
chance

attributes of war
fluidity 
Each episode of war is the temporary result of a unique combination of circumstances presenting a unique set of problems that require an original solution.    

disorder
inherent characteristic of war
we can never eliminate it
plans will go awry in the heat of battle
communications will fail
mistakes and unforseen events will be commonplay


complexity
 Efforts to fully centralize military operations and to exert complete control by a single decision-maker are inconsistent with the intrinsically complex and distributed nature of war. 

an extreme trial of the human dimension
the human dimension
war is shaped by human nature and is subject to complexity

violence and danger
 War is among the greatest horrors known to humanity.

    It should never be romanticized.
    It is applied in the form of organized violence.
    We use force to bend the enemy to our will.
    Violence is an essential element of war.  
    Danger is ever-present. 

    
physical moral and mental forces
 Physical:

    Generally easily seen, understood, and measured
    Equipment, capabilities, and supplies
    Physical objectives seized, force ratios, losses of matériel or life
    Terrain lost or gained; prisoners or matériel captured

Moral:

    Pertains to those forces of a psychological rather than tangible nature
    Term not restricted to ethics, although ethics are certainly included  
    Difficult to grasp and impossible to quantify  

Mental:

    Provide the ability to grasp complex battlefield situations
    Make effective estimates, calculations, and decisions
    Devise tactics and strategies
    Develop plans

Evolution of war
war is both timeless and everchanging 
Changes may be gradual in some cases and drastic in others.  Drastic changes in war are typically the result of developments that dramatically upset the equilibrium of war such as the rifled bore, mass conscription, and the railroad.
One major catalyst of change is the advancement of technology.  As the hardware of war improves through technological development, so must the tactical, operational, and strategic usage adapt to its improved capabilities both to maximize our own capabilities and to counteract our enemy's.

the sscience and art of war 
Science of War:
-

Methodical application of the empirical laws of nature  

-

Activities directly subject to the laws of ballistics, mechanics, and like disciplines

-

The application of fires, the effects of weapons, and the rates and methods of movement and resupply

Art of War:  
-

Employment of creative or intuitive skills

-

The creative, situational application of scientific knowledge through judgment and experience

-

Creative ability to devise a practical solution

-

Involves conceiving strategies and tactics and developing plans of action to suit a given situation

Dynamic of War:
-

War is a social phenomenon.   It is a competitive human interaction.

-

Human beings interact with each other in ways different from the way a scientist works with chemicals or formulas or the way an artist works with paints or musical notes.

-

Because of this dynamic of human interaction, fortitude, perseverance, boldness, esprit, and other traits not explainable by art or science are essential in war.

Stability operations promote peace

general war global confict between major powers


levels of war 
strategic
highest level of war
policy objectives
Strategy derived from political and policy objectives must be clearly understood to be the sole authoritative basis for all operations.

operational
level links strategic and tactical levels 
the use of tactical results to attain strategic objectives 
Actions at this level imply a broader dimension of time and space than actions at the tactical level.  
As strategy deals with winning wars and tactics with winning battles and engagements, the operational level of war is the art and science of winning campaigns.
 Its means are tactical results, and its ends are the established strategic objectives.

tactical
lowest level of war tactics refer to teh concepts methods used to accomplish a particular mission in either combat or other military operations


initiative is the ability to dictate terms of the conflict and force the enemy to meet on these terms

respoonse
Response is reaction to the initiative; it is how you respond to the opposition.  The responding, or second, party must have the desire and will to resist for conflict to take place.  

Response is typically associated with defense.
Defense aims to resist the enemy's will.  It also creates the opportunity for initiative.

combat power total destructive force to bring upon the enemy

speed
rapidity of action speed over time is temp and speed and tempo are weapons

focus
Focus is the convergence of combat power on the objective

suprise
Surprise creates disorientation from an unexpected act that degrades the enemy's will. Surprise is a weapon.  Surprise can lead to shock and allows small forces to defeat larger forces

boldness
Boldness is exploiting the disorderly nature of war unhesitatingly

center of gravity and critical vulnerabilities
center of gravity COG
Centers of gravity are any important sources of strength

critical vulnerabilities CV
We want to attack the source of enemy strength, but we do not want to attack directly into that strength

C2 command and control
exercise of authority and direction by a properly designatred commander
C2 is the key to achieving unity of effort and realizing the full combat potential of the unit.

Basic elements of C2
people 
information
c2 support structure


Purpose:

Statement of the purpose for conducting the operation.

This should include the “In order to” portion of the mission statement i.e. the “why”.
It is re-communicated to ensure subordinates comprehension.

Method:

Statement of the commander’s over-arching plan for exploitation of the enemy’s key weakness and mission success. The method should include:

Enemy Key Strength. Our Warfighting doctrine is based in the concept of maneuver warfare, in which we avoid surfaces and mass our firepower at the enemy’s gaps.  To do this, leaders, after having completed their estimate of the situation, will determine what provides strength to the enemy.
Enemy Key Weakness. The converse of the enemy’s key strength is where we seek to focus our force.  The key weakness is the gap that when struck renders the enemy’s key strength ineffective, without having to strike the key strength directly.
Exploitation plan. Here the leader articulates how the enemy’s key weakness will be exploited by the unit’s scheme of maneuver.

Endstate:

Leaders describe their vision of the battlefield after the dust has settled.

This endstate is relative to enemy units, friendly units, and terrain.
Ensuring that the desired endstate is pushed to all subordinates provides for flexibility on the battlefield, for if all subordinates clearly understand the desired endstate, they are capable of independently driving that goal even if the original proposed plan goes awry.

Four types of combat operation centers

main
is tactical headquarters where the command and staff perform their activities it is semi permanent and established short of th erange of the enemys weapon systems

forward
The forward COC is the echelon of the headquarters that is located well forward on the battlefield so the commander has a command post near subordinate commanders and can directly influence operation

alternate
The alternate COC is a redundant C2 capability for the unit.
The alternate COC is any location designated by a commander to assume C2 functions in the event that the main COC becomes inoperative.
The alternate COC may be partially or fully equipped and staffed or it may be the main COC of a subordinate unit.
The alternate COC should have equivalent equipment and personnel as the main COC. 

rear
The rear COC is the rear echelon of a unit's headquarters and is primarily concerned with logistics and administrative functions that cannot or should not be conducted in the area of operation.

 Art of tactics
  The Art of  Tactics

•Defined as three interrelated aspects:

-
A creative and flexible array of means to accomplish assigned missions

-

Decision-making under conditions of uncertainty

-
	
Understanding the human dimension

•Involves the creation, positioning, and maneuver of combat power:

-
	
Creativity is a developed capacity acquired through education, practice, and experience.
 The Science of Tactics

•This is defined as the understanding of those military aspects of tactics—capabilities, techniques, and procedures—that can be measured and codified.

•Artistry and creativity in the application of this aspect of tactics are impossible


forms of manuever
frontal attack
This maneuver is directed against the front of the enemy forces. 
flanking attack
This form of maneuver is directed at the flank of an enemy force. 
envelopment
An envelopment is an offensive maneuver used to secure objectives to the enemy's rear
turning movement
This is a variation of the envelopment used to secure objectives deep in the rear area of the enemy.  Normally, the main effort executes the turning movement as the supporting effort fixes the enemy in position. 
infiltration
This form of maneuver requires forces to move over, through, or around enemy positions without detection to assume a position of advantage over the enemy. 
penetration
This is a form of maneuver where an attacking force seeks to rupture enemy defenses.  A penetration concentrates overwhelmingly superior combat power on a narrow front and in depth. 


warfighting skills
marksmanship
"Every Marine a rifleman." 
weapons employement
Machine guns provide a high volume of accurate fire in support of the infantry in both the offense and defense.
land navigation
his skill must be trained, practiced, and sustained at every level from schools to individuals units. 
close air support
CAS is air action by fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft against hostile targets that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and requires detailed integration of each air mission with the fire and movement of those forces. 

TTPs
Tactics 
The employement of units in combat
