```


## Indexing
```
$myarray = 'Hellow', 12, (get-date), $False

$myarray[0]
Hellow

$myarray[0][1]
e

$myarray[0][5]
w
```
indexing is the same as in python


## Nested Arrays
```
$var += 1
2

$newarray = @()  # Multi Array using @() empty array

$newarray.GetType()
Array

$newarray += 1
1

$newarray += 2
1
2
```


Multifunctional array
```
$myarray = @((1,2,3,4)(5,6,7,8)) # Jagged Array
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8

$myarray[0]

```

## Pipeline " | "
```
Get-Process | Get-Member

Get-Help | Format-List

```


## Sort
```
Get-Process | sort -Property Name
Get-process | get-member | where-object -property name -EQ ID
```

## Aliases
Get-Alias

```
Get-Alias ls
ls - Get-ChildItem

```

Setting Alias
```
Set-Alias edit notepad.exe

edit # Should Open Notepad.exe
```
